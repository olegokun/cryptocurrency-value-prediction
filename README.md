# Cryptocurrency Value Prediction
*Cryptocurrency value prediction with LSTM neural networks*
 
This project aims to explore cryptocurrency value prediction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The prediction problem is posed as time-series prediction where past (historic) data serve for LSTM model training while a trained model performs predictions one-period (say, one week) ahead of the current date. Many implementations of time-series prediction output only a point prediction, i.e., one number, while ignoring uncertainty inherent in point estimates. I decided to add the prediction interval for each predicted value. 

A prediction interval is ... 

This project is built on the works of other people as code reusing is more optimal than writing everything from scratch. I will acknowledge their work later on this page by providing necessary links.

To be done!
1. Definition of prediction interval
2. Explain code in notebook, crypto.env settings and results
3. Add a notebook where both predictions and their prediction intervals are computed by one model instead of three models
4. Add code of dockerized app
