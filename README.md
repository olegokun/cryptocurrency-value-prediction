### Cryptocurrency Value Prediction
 Cryptocurrency value prediction with LSTM neural networks
 
This project aims to explore cryptocurrency value prediction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The prediction problem is posed as time-series prediction where past (historic) data serve for LSTM model training while a trained model performs predictions one-period (say, one week) ahead of the current date.

This project is built on the works of other people as code reusing is more optimal than writing everything from scratch. I will acknowledge their work later on this page by providing necessary links.
